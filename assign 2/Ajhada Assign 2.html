    <!-- Story text with expert quote -->
    <p>Since its 2010 landmark designation, West Park Presbyterian Church has seen over 60 complaints to the Department of Buildings, highlighting decades of unsafe scaffolding, cracked masonry, and falling debris. Advocates argue the historic structure deserves restoration, while critics say maintenance burdens threaten the congregation’s survival.</p>

    <p>On Dec. 9, the New York City Landmarks Preservation Commission (LPC) will hold a decisive hearing that will determine whether the 19th-century church can be demolished - a ruling that follows years of bitter debate, and a recent 25-15 vote by the Community Board 7 opposing the church’s hardship application for the third time.</p>
    
    <p>When the LPC landmarks a property, exterior changes and demolitions require commission approval. Owners must preserve the historic character, which often comes at a great cost, according to church leaders. 

    <p>West Park’s congregation fought its 2010 designation warning that restoration would be prohibitively expensive. Fifteen years later, those predictions became central to its financial hardship application. Roger Leaf, chair of the West Park Administrative Commission reports less than $600 in its bank account, more than $200,000 in debt, and repairs that exceed $55 million. </p>

  <p>“The denial of the hardship would not necessarily save the building," Leaf said at the first October hearing since re-submitting the hardship letter. “But it would almost certainly mean the end of a storied 140-year-old congregation. The building would continue to decline until a buyer could be found and repairs could be made and the sidewalk bridge surrounding the building would likely remain in place for the foreseeable future.”</p>

  <p>Department of Buildings records cited in the filing illustrate deterioration of the sandstone facade so severe that sidewalk bridges erected in 2000 have remained in place for 25 years. The church has 85 total violations with 76 currently open, “severe masonry spalling,” “open mortar joints” and walls “leaning out of plumb” are just a few.</p>
